## Game Description
This project is a mobile game developed for children aged 5 and above to assist them in protecting the environment by teaching them how to sort and recycle their waste. Students or children participate in the game by sorting their waste into bins designated for paper, plastic, electronic waste, glass, metal, and organic waste. This project is a 2D Unity game developed for mobile (Android). The project is still in the development stage. If you have any questions, you can reach me via email.

## How to Play

When you start the game, waste moves randomly from side to side. When the incoming waste aligns with the correct recycling bin, you can tap the screen once, and the waste will fall into the bin. You earn 1 point for each piece of waste that correctly lands in the bin, and you do not score points for waste that falls into the wrong bin. The game has no end, so you can stop it whenever you want.
